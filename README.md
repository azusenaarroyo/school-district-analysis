# School District Analysis with Pandas

## Overview of the School District Analysis
The purpose of this School District Analysis is to provide insights on performance trends and patterns of all standardized tests data. These insights will be used to drive discussions and strategic planning at the school and district level by showcasing trends in school performance.
